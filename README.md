# Proposals for Shopware 6.5.0.0

In this proposal we are collecting breaking change topics for the next major version. 
This list is still in work and not **final**.
We want to collect with this repository the feedback from the community and include your topics into the next major. 

# Prioritization and voting
Ofcourse not all topics are possible to integrate, for this reason we have to priorize any topic by need and the effort. 
**For this reason please use the reactions on the issues to upvote it.** 👍
